Our designs start with a shared assessment of the client’s brief. We don’t start any design with any preconceived notions. We explore each design in an open and collaborative environment and understand the importance of meeting face to face on a regular basis. We use visual mood boards to present design ideas and verify performance and compliance using software modelling. We investigate new technologies and carry out due diligence, life cycle analysis and return on investment. We incorporate sustainable design principles in all our designs and work with ESD engineers to meet targets and objectives. We aim to develop sustainable, innovate and creative design solutions and provide a competitive advantage as our best designers are working on each project throughout design and construction.
